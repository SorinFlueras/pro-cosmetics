OnSale Page is an extension for Woocommerce which enables you to have real on sale page with paging, sorting and filtering.

== Description ==

OnSale Page for WooCommerce is an extension for Woocommerce. Since WooCommerce is popular we decided that it would be neat to
extend it with real WordPress page which displays products on sale. We developed this plugin because WooCommerce
has onsale widget and shortcode but it lacks paging, sorting and filtering which you can usually find on regular WooCommerce catalog page.

With our onsale page plugin you can setup OnSale Page for WooCommerce where you can display all products that are on sale.
